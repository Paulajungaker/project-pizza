# Project Name

Introduction to Javascript creating a way to order from a restaurant site. 

## The problem

This project when pretty smooth but had some issues on the way. I was a bit unsure of how to make the confirmation tell what the person had ordered in the fifth step but managed to find a way to make it kind of simple. My first thought was that I would have to do it through if, else-if and else for all the options but that would have been messy and taken a lot more time. This project did not need so much of planning since the structure was already built. If I had more time it would have been fun to play around more and see what more you can create with Javascript.
